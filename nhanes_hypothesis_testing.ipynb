This test is used if we have specified a particular value as the null value for the proportion, and we wish to assess if the data are compatible with the true parameter value being equal to this specified value.  One-sample tests are not used very often in practice, because it is not very common that we have a specific fixed value to use for comparison. \n",

The results in the first (default) case below are slightly different from the results obtained above because Statsmodels by default uses the sample proportion instead of the null proportion when computing the standard error.  This distinction is rarely consequential, but we can specify that the null proportion should be used to calculate the standard error, and the results agree exactly with what we calculated above.  The first two lines below carry out tests using the normal approximation to the sampling distribution of the test statistic, and the third line below carries uses the exact binomial sampling distribution.  We can see here that the p-values are nearly identical in all three cases. This is expected when the sample size is large, and the proportion is not close to either 0 or 1."

    "Comparative tests tend to be used much more frequently than tests comparing one population to a fixed value.  A two-sample test of proportions is used to assess whether the proportion of individuals with some trait differs between two sub-populations.  For example, we can compare the smoking rates between females and males. Since smoking rates vary strongly with age, we do this in the subpopulation of people between 20 and 25 years of age.  In the cell below, we carry out this test without using any libraries, implementing all the test procedures covered elsewhere in the course using Python code.  We find that the smoking rate for men is around 10 percentage points greater than the smoking rate for females, and this difference is statistically significant (the p-value is around 0.01)."

    "The standard error of the mean difference (e.g. mean female blood pressure minus mean male blood pressure) can be estimated in at least two different ways.  In the statsmodels library, these approaches are referred to as the \"pooled\" and the \"unequal\" approach to estimating the variance.  If the variances are equal (i.e. there is no heteroscedasticity), then there should be little difference between the two approaches.  Even in the presence of moderate heteroscedasticity, as we have here, we can see that the results for the two methods are quite similar.  Below we have a loop that considers each 10-year age band and assesses the evidence for a difference in mean BMI for women and for men.  The results printed in each row of output are the test-statistic and p-value."

    "A common situation in applied research is to measure the same quantity multiple times on each unit of analysis.  For example, in NHANES, systolic blood pressure is measured at least two times (sometimes there is a third measurement) on each subject.  Although the measurements are repeated, there is no guarantee that the mean is the same each time, i.e. the mean blood pressure may be slightly lower on the second measurement compared to the first, since people are a bit more nervous the first time they are measured.  A paired test is a modified form of mean test that can be used when we are comparing two repeated measurements on the same unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A paired t-test for means is equivalent to taking the difference between the first and second measurement, and using a one-sample test to compare the mean of these differences to zero. Below we see that in the entire NHANES sample, the first measurement of systolic blood pressure is on average 0.67 mm/Hg greater than the second measurement.  While this difference is not large, it is strongly statistically significant.  That is, there is strong evidence that the mean values for the first and second blood pressure measurement differ."

There is also a difference between the genders, with older men having a stronger difference between the first and second blood pressure measurements than older women.  The gender difference for younger peple is less clear."

    "Like nearly any analysis with data, hypothesis tests will yield more sensitive and confident results when there are larger amounts of data.  Here we will study the relationship between the sample size (amount of data), and the behavior of a hypothesis test.  For illustration, we will use the paired t-test for assessing whether the first and second systolic blood pressure measurement have different means, restricting to people between 50 and 60 years of age.\n",

    "The simulation below randomly subsamples sets of 100, 200, 400, and 800 people from the 50-60 year old subset of NHANES, and conducts a paired z-test on each subsample.  This process is repeated 500 times for each sample size.  We report the fraction of these 500 trials where the p-value was smaller than 0.05.  A higher fraction of trials where p<0.05 implies that it is easier to detect a difference between the first and second blood pressure measurements.  We see that this proportion (called \"statistical power\") is only around 0.2 when the sample size is 100, and grows to essentially 100% when the sample size is 800.  Note that all of these subsamples are drawn from the same parent population, so there is no change from subsample to subsample in terms of whether the means are truly different.  The only thing that changes is our evidence that the difference is real.  When the sample size is small, we rarely amass such evidence."
